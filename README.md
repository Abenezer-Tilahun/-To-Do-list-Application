Our goal here is to Build a To-do list application with add, remove and checked feature from scratch using JavaScripts Click [here](https://abenezer-tilahun.github.io/To-Do-list-Application/) to get a live preview of the project

# Features implemented so far are:

- Responsive HTML page
- Integrated webpack
- dynamic to-do list dom manipulation
- Add a task to list [Hit enter key to add a new task]
- Edit a task to list [this is done on editable and hit enter key to save to list]
- Save current state to local-storage.
- Addition of unit test using Jest.

# Built With

- Lighthouse (An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more).
- Webhint (A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility, and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors).
- Stylelint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles).
- ESlint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in JavaScript codes)
- Webpack (Used for bundling JavaScript files for usage in a browser)
- Jest (A JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


# Prerequisites

The basic requirements for building the executable are:

npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
```
##### For validation detection using Stylelint Run
```
